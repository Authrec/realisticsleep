## FAQ
Q: Forge pls?  
A: No. I don't have the time to learn another modding framework, however you can port over the mod yourself (GPLv3) if you want, source code is here.

Q: Will you backport this mod?  
A: No.

Q: Does this mod work in multiplayer?  
A: Yes! The night goes by a little faster for each player that's sleeping at the same time.

Q: Can you still avoid rain/thunder by sleeping?  
A: Yes. After sleeping until dawn the weather will return to normal. I might make this configurable in the future, let me know if you want this.

## Incompatibilities
Any mods that add sleep voting, or otherwise modify the sleeping mechanic itself will not work with this mod (sleep voting already exists by design).  
Any mods which simply add buffs/debuffs after waking up should work.
